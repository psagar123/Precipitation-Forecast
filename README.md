# Precipitation-Forecast
Our aim in this project is to develop a simple precipitation forecast model based on prevailing air temperature, relative humidity, and sea level pressure. Precipitation is one of the most difficult field to forecast in weather/climate models because of its large spatiotemporal variability. The aim in this project is to develop a simple regression model that can show some skills in capturing certain aspect of precipitation and make some decent forecast over the region of California. Because the training data were derived from the California region, the model works the best for this region. Although forecasting in other cities is possible, the prediction model might show lesser skills. This project is neither a precipitation forecast model per se nor a replacement for more comprehensive weather models. This project only aims to demonstrate a proof of concept of a simple forecast model using machine learning/regression models. This model was developed based on the notion that an effective forecast model should be simple to use and use as little parameter as possible to make a reasonable forecast.
